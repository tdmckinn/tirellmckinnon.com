I took some time for black history month to work a new site [blackthoughts](http://www.blackthoughts.life/) which started as a way to for me to look into more information on black history and what people where saying about the topic around culture.

Also, I added some useful information regarding diversity scholarships that could help someone looking to gain more expsoure into the tech scene with the avaliable resources.
